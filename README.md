This project explores how simple quantitative factor signals can be used to form and evaluate systematic equity portfolios. 
Using Python, publicly available price data, and statistical modeling, the project compares the performance of factor-based portfolios against a benchmark over multiple years.

Checklist:
- Historical data collection using `yfinance`
- Factor construction for momentum and volatility
- Monthly rebalancing engine with equal-weight portfolios
- Performance metrics: CAGR, volatility, Sharpe, max drawdown
- Visual analytics with Matplotlib
